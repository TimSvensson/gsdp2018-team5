* A simple branching work-flow will be adopted.

* Users will create a new branch with master as a base and will name it appropriately with the user story they are currently working on.

**WHEN THE HEAD IS AT MASTER**

```bash
    git branch
```

*OUTPUT :*

```bash
    * master
```

```bash
    git checkout -b <NAME OF THE USER STORY>
```

**USER WILL WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BRANCHES BRANCH**

* Users will always add proper commit messages.

*EX :*
```bash
    git commit README.md -m "Updated README file with rules for code collaboration"
```

* Users will always push to their respective branches

```bash
    git push origin <NAME OF THE USER STORY>
```

* A minor code review will be employed before a pull request will be opened.

* Finally the user can create a pull request via github, which will be approved by the project owner.
